\section{Halo assembly bias}
The clustering of dark matter haloes is dependent on their constituent masses. This translates observationally into more massive and passive galaxies being more clustered than their lower mass counterparts. The dependence of halo clustering on properties outside of the driving factor of halo mass has been termed `\textit{halo assembly bias}'. Halo spin, concentration and formation time have been found, in simulations, to alter halo clustering, however observationally we are yet to determine whether these are independent or a secondary effect of density and hence halo mass. The motivation of this thesis lies therein.
