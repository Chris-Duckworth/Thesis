\epigraph{This chapter is based on Duckworth, Tojeiro and Kraljic, in MNRAS, XXX, Issue X, 2020 and Duckworth, Starkenburg, Genel, Davis, Habouzit, Kraljic and Tojeiro (submitted). Here we investigate kinematically misaligned galaxies in the cosmological scale simulation IllustrisTNG. We make direct comparison to observations and investigate the relationship of misalignment identified at $z=0$ with the evolutionary histories of halo spin, gas properties and AGN feedback.}
