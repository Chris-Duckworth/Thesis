\chapter{Abstract}
We are now in an era of spatially resolved spectroscopic observations for thousands of galaxies. Labelled integral field spectroscopy, a natural product is detailed kinematics of both stars and gas enabling accurate estimators of a galaxy's angular momentum, and hence, kinematic classifications. This presents a significant step forward in how we understand and classify galaxies, previously being reliant on their visual form; morphology. In tandem, significant progress has also been made in theory with realistic, cosmological simulations becoming a reality. These high resolution simulations, coupled with hydrodynamics, have produced populations of thousands of galaxies; replicating a wide variety of properties of actual galaxies in our observable Universe. Both will be crucial in further understanding how galaxies evolve to what we find in the local Universe. 

This thesis uses the natural synergy between integral field spectroscopy and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, to help understand the angular momentum content of galaxies in the local Universe. We investigate the relationship between thousands of galaxies' stellar and gas kinematics using both real and mock observations, to better understand the reliability of such simulations, and, how they can intuit their evolutionary histories.

In this thesis, we investigate how the rotational direction of stars and gas can become \textit{decoupled} (kinematic misalignment) and how this is related to the galaxy's morphology and the angular momentum content of the surrounding dark matter halo (Chapter 2). We also demonstrate the relationship between kinematic misalignment and stellar angular momentum, and how both are impacted by the role of feedback from supermassive black holes (Chapter 3), and, their large-scale environment. In particular, we investigate how the magnitude and direction of angular momentum in galaxies is modulated by their position within the cosmic web (Chapter 4), and, how kinematic misalignment is related to the assembly history of their dark matter halo (Chapter 5). Finally this thesis investigates the potential to recover the dynamics of dark matter within different large-scale environments (Chapter 6), motivating a novel application of the axisymmetric Jean's equations using whole galaxies as tracers. This work helps lay the foundation for using integral field spectroscopy and cosmological simulations \textit{in tandem} as a powerful tool in building a holistic picture of galaxy evolution.

\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Well s***. Hello from a pandemic. At least I have a reason to be a total recluse while writing this. If you are like me and browse through acknowledgements in theses, I often wondered why so often the phrase `I didn't know if I'd make it here' was used given the incredible people that wrote them. Well, when it all came crashing down I realised. So if you are questioning it yourself; just remember you've got this, and, \textit{you} should always come before what you are doing. And if you don't feel like you belong because of gender, race or anything else that supposedly divides us: you do. 

Firstly to Rita, thank you. I was at a crossroads before my PhD, but your kindness was a large part of why I came back to St Andrews. You are a better supervisor than you know, and certainly than you'd ever admit. \textit{Sorry that my sarcasm wore down the professionalism of our meetings over the years.} To everyone else that helped guide me through the minefield of galaxies and dark matter, especially Katarina and Shy, I'll always be grateful.

To every single friend from St Andrews, thank you. Rural Scotland is a weird place to pick really, but I'm glad you all did too. A special shout out to my flatmates Dom and Carl; I don't think a flat will ever sound the same without Carl's hysteric laughter in the background. To all of my friends from my time in New York: \textit{what it is}. 

To Giuls, the only person that swears more than me, I doubt there's anyone else I would have stayed close friends with after 4 years apart. Good job we're both so full of s*** (love you really). To Maya, BFFLTT (??), the amount of cheese we ate in Notts was probably what sustained me to get through this. I'll always be grateful that you stuck around despite not knowing if I liked you for the first 2 months of our friendship. To Kristin, gingerbread and craft extraordinaire, thank you for making Scotland feel like home; I hope I helped do the same for you. At least we're both done with polar coordinates.

Lastly, and quite the opposite of least, thank you to my Mum, Dad, and, family. I wouldn't be able to spend a few years getting distracted about galaxies if it wasn't for every one of you. I love you to pieces.
